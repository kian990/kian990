- Hi I'm Kian!
- As a computer science undergraduate with a diverse range of interests spanning web and software development, design, video editing, and art, I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of design and technology in elevating user experiences within web applications.
- Moreover, I am eager to extend this passion beyond digital realms and into curating immersive and innovative experiences, as well as creating engaging and visually striking designs. Whether it's through creating videos, producing and composing media, or orchestrating artistic showcases, I am motivated to explore avenues where technology and creativity converge to captivate audiences in unique and memorable ways.
- Thus, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity that will not only bolster my skills but also provide me with the platform to channel my creativity and expertise into meaningful projects.
